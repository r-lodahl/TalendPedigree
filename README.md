# TalendPedigree

This repository contains the whole workspace of Talend containing a simple TOS-ETL-Job to transform ped-files into tab-separated files that can be integrated into the tranSMART-database using transmart-Batch.

The workspace contains three example files: in.map, in.ped, in.study. In the folder output, the converted input-files are presented, that are based on this three example files.
